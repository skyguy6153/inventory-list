# inventory-list
###  A sort of "check off list" I made for my job. Basically, since I help rig state vehicles, I'm able to input an items part number, description, location, and quantity onto the list. The items are saved on local storage of the users PC, so that way it doesn't delete the list when refreshing the page. I also gave this list the ability to strikethrough items. That way, as I'm getting parts for vehicles, I can keep track of what I already pulled. There is also a button to add another line, if you want to add more products to the list.
### This is my first time utilizing  a bit of JSON, so that's pretty neat!
